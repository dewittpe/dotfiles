# Arcived Files

Dot files and other things I used once and no longer need, but it might be
helpful to have the files for referece at a later date without going back
through the history of the dotfile repo.

## NOTES:

I prefer to have the keymapping between capslock and esc reversed.  This can be
acheived in the console (linux) by
```bash
sudo loadkeys swap_esc_capslock.kmap
```
See [this superuser.com post](superuser.com/question/290115/how-to-change-console-keymap-in-linux)
for details.  For the GUI I tend to stick with the manual settings through the
system settings gui.

__HOWEVER__ Ergodox keyboard has the mappings as part of the firmware so the
above is not needed.

If needed, use the GUI to make this change on Mac and Ubuntu.
